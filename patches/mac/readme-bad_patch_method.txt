This isn't the best way to make the OneShot.app as the OneShot_template.app is a copy of the .app provided by Steam, with some modifications to Info.plist and the icon.  I (Vinyl Darkscratch) am not too familiar with QMake, sadly, and as such I'm not quite sure how to copy all the essential frameworks through the QMake file.  If anyone can suggest a better way, please let me know by emailing me at vinyldarkscratch at the Gmail!
