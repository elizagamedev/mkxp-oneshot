# About filesystem paths specified in this config:
# The "gameFolder" path is resolved either relative
# to the directory containing the Oneshot executable
# (the default behavior), or relative to the current
# working directory (when compiled with
# -DWORKDIR_CURRENT). All other paths are resolved
# relative to gameFolder and ignoring both RTPs and
# encrypted archives.

# Use a fixed framerate that is approx. equal to the

# "fixedFramerate" because the actual frame rate is
# reported back to the game, ensuring correct timers.
# If the screen refresh rate cannot be determined,

# Limit the maximum size (width, height) of
# most textures mkxp will create (exceptions are

# RTP=/path/to/rtp1
# RTP=/path/to/rtp2.zip
# RTP=/path/to/game.rgssad


# Font substitutions allow drop-in replacements of fonts
# to be used without changing the RGSS scripts,
# eg. providing 'Open Sans' when the game thinkgs it's
# using 'Arial'. Font family to be substituted and
# replacement family are separated by one sole '>'.
# Be careful not to include any spaces.
# This is not connected to the built-in font, which is
# always used when a non-existing font family is
# requested by RGSS.

# fontSub=Arial>Open Sans
# fontSub=Times New Roman>Liberation Serif


# Because mkxp is usually distributed as a stand alone
# build, no predefined load paths are initialized
# ($:, $LOAD_PATH) in the MRI backend. With this option,
# they can be specified manually (eg. when using a system
# libruby.so). It is however recommended to statically
# link all required gems into libruby.so.
